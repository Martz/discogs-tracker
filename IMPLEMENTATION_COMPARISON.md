# Discogs Tracker - Implementation Comparison

This project now offers two complete implementations of the Discogs price tracker:

## ðŸ¦€ Rust Implementation (Recommended)

**Advantages:**
- **Performance**: Native performance with zero overhead
- **Memory efficiency**: Lower memory usage and better resource management
- **Concurrency**: Built-in async/await with tokio for efficient API calls
- **Safety**: Memory safety and thread safety guaranteed at compile time
- **Single binary**: No runtime dependencies, easy deployment

**Build & Run:**
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/discogs-tracker --help
```

## ðŸ“œ TypeScript Implementation (Original)

**Advantages:**
- **Ecosystem**: Rich npm ecosystem and familiar development environment
- **Rapid development**: Dynamic typing and familiar syntax for JS/TS developers
- **Debugging**: Excellent tooling support and IDE integration
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify and extend during development

**Build & Run:**
```bash
npm run build
node dist/cli.js --help
```

## Feature Parity

Both implementations provide identical functionality:

| Feature | Rust | TypeScript | Notes |
|---------|------|------------|-------|
| CLI Interface | âœ… | âœ… | Same commands and options |
| Database Operations | âœ… | âœ… | Compatible SQLite schema |
| Discogs API Integration | âœ… | âœ… | Same endpoints and rate limiting |
| Configuration Management | âœ… | âœ… | Compatible config format |
| Multi-threading | âœ… | âœ… | Tokio async vs Worker pools |
| Error Handling | âœ… | âœ… | Comprehensive in both |

## Performance Comparison

Expected performance characteristics:

| Aspect | Rust | TypeScript |
|--------|------|------------|
| Startup Time | ~10ms | ~100ms |
| Memory Usage | ~10MB | ~50MB |
| API Concurrency | Excellent | Good |
| Database Operations | Excellent | Good |
| Binary Size | ~15MB | ~200MB+ (with node_modules) |

## Choosing an Implementation

**Choose Rust if:**
- Performance is critical
- You want minimal resource usage
- You prefer strongly typed systems
- You need a single deployable binary

**Choose TypeScript if:**
- You're more comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript
- You need rapid prototyping and development
- You want to leverage the npm ecosystem
- You prefer familiar debugging tools

Both implementations can coexist and share the same database and configuration files.
